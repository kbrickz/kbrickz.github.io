I'm Kristen, and I'm betting a year on learning cybersecurity.

I'm coming from data work that made me feel dead inside - meaningless reports, corporate theater, asking permission to think. I have an MBA I don't use and grew up building things on the internet. Now I'm learning security to move closer to the life I actually want to live.

## What This Is

I'm documenting everything publicly. 12 months. 50+ blog posts. 6-8 security tools. Learning to hunt bugs, do research, build tools, and work autonomously.

The process will be honest. I lean on AI for implementation help. I'm autistic, so friction reduction and building in public help me stay accountable. Systems thinking clicks immediately. Programming syntax takes work.

Not training to get hired. Training to work for myself. If the right remote role appears, I'll consider it. But employment is a stepping stone, not the destination.

## What I'm Building

- **Security tools** - Python automation, starting with log parsers and scanners
- **AI security research** - LLM vulnerabilities, prompt injection, red teaming (Months 7-8)
- **Cloud security** - AWS/Azure offensive techniques (Months 5-6)
- **Bug bounty income** - Proving capability through paid findings

Financial and intellectual sovereignty. That's the goal.
