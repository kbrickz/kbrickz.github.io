# Breaking Things Better
### A year-long public journey into offensive security, AI safety, and autonomous research practice

Welcome. I'm Kristen — and this is the public lab notebook for my transition into independent security research.

I am building a practice at the intersection of:

- Offensive security & cloud exploitation  
- AI and LLM red teaming  
- Self-directed technical learning  
- Public research & open-source tooling  
- Identity re-platforming and self-authorship  

This space documents the process — not just the results.

## Why this exists

Most cybersecurity journeys are built around:
- Studying quietly  
- Collecting certificates  
- Applying for jobs  
- Waiting for permission  

This one is different.

I am not training to get hired.

I am **building the capability and proof to operate independently** — as a researcher, builder, and contributor to security in AI systems and cloud environments.

Employment is a possible outcome.  
**Autonomy is the primary goal.**

## What you will find here

- Weekly research logs & technical breakdowns  
- Open-source security tools and frameworks  
- Cloud exploitation studies  
- AI red-teaming experiments & LLM vuln research  
- Bug bounty methodology and findings (ethical & disclosed)  
- Notes on the psychology and identity work behind transition into technical agency  

## Year-long Research Roadmap Highlights

- Foundations in Linux, networking, Python, and web security  
- PortSwigger labs + custom exploit tooling  
- Cloud security: AWS/Azure exploitation & automation  
- AI red-teaming: prompt injection, tool-use attacks, indirect vectors  
- Building original security research + presenting in public  
- Establishing independent income via bug bounty and consulting

This is a **build in public** proof-of-work journey — with rigor, visibility, and accountability baked in.

If you're curious about how technical capability, identity, and sovereignty evolve together — you’re in the right place.

> _Reinvention is not running away from who you were — it’s finally becoming who you are._

Let's break things, understand why they break, and build a future where we can trust what we build.
