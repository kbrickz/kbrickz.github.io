I'm Kristen Brickner. I'm documenting a 12-month sprint to become a security researcher, with focus on AI and cloud security.

## About This Blog

I'm transitioning from data analytics to security research. This blog tracks the process: what I'm building, what I'm learning, what's working and what isn't.

I'm building in public. Every tool, every lesson, every mistake. The goal is financial and intellectual autonomy - bug bounty income, independent research, maybe the right remote role if it appears. Employment is an option, not the destination.

## What I'm Working On

**Month 1-2: Foundations**
Python security tools, Linux command line, web security fundamentals

**Month 3-4: Web Security**
PortSwigger Academy, bug bounty hunting, building exploitation tools

**Month 5-6: Cloud Security**
AWS/Azure offensive techniques, cloud-native vulnerabilities

**Month 7-8: AI Security**
LLM vulnerabilities, prompt injection, red teaming frameworks

**Month 9-12: Specialization**
Deep research, consistent bug bounty income, public tools and findings

## What You'll Find Here

Technical write-ups, tool releases, weekly reflections, honest progress reports. I use AI assistance for implementation and document the process transparently.

If you're considering a similar transition, this is the unfiltered version. Not the highlight reel.
