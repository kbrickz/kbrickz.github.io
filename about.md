# About Me

I'm Kristen Brickner, transitioning into security research with a focus on AI and cloud security.

## Background

- **Education:** MBA + Entrepreneurship BA
- **Experience** BI + ETL Automation + WebDev
- **Current Focus:** 12-month intensive security researcher curriculum
- **Specializations:** AI/LLM security, cloud security (AWS/Azure), Python automation
- **Approach:** Building in public, original research, autonomous work

## Why Security Research?

I'm coming from work that makes me feel dead inside, where I've been solving problems that don't matter, 
and where each day felt like waiting for permission to actually use my brain. I'd like to prove to myself
that I can do hard things. I need evidence that I'm capable of mastering something genuinely complex and 
valuable. I also want work where masking isn't required to survive. I'm autistic. I'm exhausted from performing
"normal" in environments that punish depth, reward superficiality, and treat divergent thinking as a liability
rather than an asset.


## What I'm Building

Over the next 12 months, I'm:
- Building 6-8 major security tools (Python-based)
- Publishing 50+ blog posts documenting research and learning
- Hunting bugs and discovering vulnerabilities
- Contributing to AI safety and cloud security research

## Skills & Focus Areas

**Technical:**
- Python security automation
- Web application security (OWASP Top 10)
- Cloud security (AWS, Azure)
- AI/LLM red teaming
- Linux command line

**Research Interests:**
- Prompt injection and LLM vulnerabilities
- Cloud misconfigurations and exploitation
- Supply chain security
- Offensive security automation
