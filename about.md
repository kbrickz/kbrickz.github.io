# About Me

Hi — I'm **Kristen** (she/her).

I'm a transgender woman rebuilding my life, identity, and capabilities from first principles.

My work draws from three pillars:

### Cognitive rigor

Systems thinking, structured research, and high-resolution learning habits.

### Technical security

Offensive security, cloud exploitation, AI system red-teaming, and building open-source security tooling.

### Personal sovereignty

Self-directed skill-building, autonomy over work, and refusing to wait for external permission to become capable.

I’m not “breaking into” security —  
I’m building myself into a security researcher in public, one week at a time.

### What I'm doing

This blog documents a 12-month sprint to:

- Ship open-source security tools
- Perform original research
- Build a reputation through proof, not potential
- Earn independent income (bug bounty + consulting)
- Contribute meaningfully to AI and cloud security conversations

I believe in open learning, visible struggle, and earned capability.

### What matters to me

- Autonomy over my time, mind, and identity
- Craft over credentialism
- Systems over shortcuts
- Deep work over performative productivity
- Public work over private aspiration

I’m not chasing titles, certificates, or permission.

I am building toward mastery and independence, and taking you with me.



### If you're here, you probably care about:

- AI safety & security
- Offensive security research
- Ethical hacking & bug bounty
- Cloud exploitation and defense
- Trans self-determination & identity truth
- Becoming someone powerful through discipline and curiosity

Welcome.  
Watch me build — and feel free to build alongside me.
